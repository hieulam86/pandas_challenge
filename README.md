Summary of Analysis:
  The dataset contained information about different schools, number of students and their performance in two subjects such as maths and reading. The    
  analysiss aimed to provide key metrics such as school budgets, student performance, passing rate, etc.

Two Conclusions and Comparisons according to the calculations:

1.  One of the findings is the relationship between school budget and student performance. Based on the schools spending on each student, the higher spending does not necessarily guarantee better academice outcomes. Schools with lower budgets (less than $630 per student) show that they have similar or even higher passing rates in both maths and reading compared to schools with higher budgets. This suggests number of factors such as teaching quality and student engagement influence student achievement.

2.  Based on the calculations, smaller schools with less than 1000 students tend to have higher average scores and passing percentages than medium and large-sized schools. This suggests that small-sized schools may provide a more conducive environment for personalised attention and effective teaching strategies.

These conclusions highlight nature of educational outcomes and underscore the importance of focusing on effective teaching practices, student engagement, and resource allocation rathan relying solely on higher budgets or school sizes.
